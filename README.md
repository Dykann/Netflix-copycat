# Netflix

In order to demonstrate my abilities to reproduce any website mock-up (<strong>interface</strong>) <br>
I chose to re-create from scratch 3 three famous social media: <strong> YouTube, Netflix and Facebook </strong> <br>
The current one <strong> Netflix </strong> is <strong> Responsive </strong> <br>
I Integrated it with: <strong> HTML,SASS and JS</strong> 

You can check the website on: https://netflix-dykann.netlify.app/
